# Bugbot Review Rules
Focus PR reviews on:
- Does change violate Hard Rules in `.cursor/rules/index.mdc`?
- Are Menu/FAQ edits done in JSON/MD (not hard-coded)?
- Are links to Square/DD/UE/GH valid?
- Mobile layout sanity: buttons tap targets â‰¥ 44px.
Fail the review if scope-creep (APIs, DB, CMS) is introduced.
